## Automation of nuclear material cladding coating measurement process

### Bachelor thesis


The data used in this work are from researchers using scanning electron microscope images
to investigate the properties of oxidation and coating layers on various materials essential
to the nuclear industry. Accurately measuring the thickness of these layers is important for
material characterization. The current manual measurement process is time-consuming,
and automating it can significantly improve efficiency. Many algorithms can assist with
automation, varying widely in complexity and input expectations. While many of these
algorithms promise powerful and accurate results, real-world scenarios require substantial
groundwork before these tools can be effectively deployed and automation established.
This work discusses the challenges and solutions encountered, beginning with the col-
lection and assessment of all available data. It then explores experiments with both
conventional computer vision and machine learning algorithms, evaluating their perfor-
mance. The overall parameters of different solutions are examined, and the most suitable
approach is selected. This approach is then seamlessly integrated into the researchersâ€™
existing workflow.
